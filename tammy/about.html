    <h1>MEET THE ARTIST</h1><br />
    <p>Mac Ayres, born December 6th, 1996 in Sea Cliff, NY, is a 22 year old singer and songwriter that specializes in creating soulful R&B music. He signed with the record label ARIMÃ‰ and is a self-taught producer,
      singer, and multi-instrumentalist with his interest in music stemming from a very early age. For instance, Ayres received his first keyboard as a gift when he was 11 and was fascinated by it - running home every day after school just to sit
      and play it. He believes, "There's something you can learn from an instrument every day, and that was just something I always enjoyed about it." This same mentality led to him learning both the guitar as well as the bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac Ayres cites his musical inspirations as Stevie Wonder, D'Angelo, J Dilla, Michael Jackson, and Marvin Gaye but nonetheless has developed his own,distinguished R&B style.
